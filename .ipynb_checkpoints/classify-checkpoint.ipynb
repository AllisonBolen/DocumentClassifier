edu lchaplyn mail sas upenn edu lida chaplynsky writes a family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on by menopause as well as a mental break down she is being treated with halydol with some success but the treatments being provided through her psychiatrist are not satisfactory someone suggested contacting a nutritionist to discuss alternative treatment since she is sensitive to medication i think this is a good suggestion but don t know where to begin if anyone can suggest a philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read i d appreciate it lida i can emphasize with your situation both my wife and i suffered from bouts of depression her s was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped i tried to use supplements to bring her out of it i had cured her pms using supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well it didn t work and she was put on prozac by her oncologist two winters ago three years after by wife s breast cancer i got hit with severe depression pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor i tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation didn t work my internist ended up putting me on prozac i was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using b niacin folate and b to cure depression i m not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like i was lida i do believe that depression can have a dietary component but the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem for chemotherapy i knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected same thing for pms i was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was pretty good depression is just too complicated what you really need is a nutritional scan this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves for every vitamin and mineral except vitamin c you have a reserve the rda is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals this is when your reserves become very important lida without your permission i m going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and sci med where i m coming from i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical schools for ten years now i ve written my own textbook because none was available what i teach is not a rehash of biochemistry i preach nutrient reserves yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons here is what i cover indroduction and carbohydrates lipids proteins i proteins ii energy balance evaluation of nutritional status i a clinical perspective evaluation of nutritional status ii evaluation of nutritional a biochemical perspective status iii homework assignment using the nutritionist iv diet and fitness analysis software program weight control food fads and facts age related change in nutrient requirements food additives contaminants and cancer drug nutrient interactions mineral and water balance sodium potassium and chloride calcium magnesium and phosphorus iron zinc and copper iodine and fluoride other trace minerals vitamin a vitamin e vitamins d and k vitamin c thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acids biotin and b other nutrient factors enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three years i spend my entire summer reviewing the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook i last did this in the summer of i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have and pages opposite each page of written text which i write myself i ve pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources since this material is only being used for educational purposes i can get around the copyright laws so far i can not send this material out to newsgroup readers as i ve been asked to do i am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab this is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients cancer treatment centers of america which is a private for profit organization with hospitals in illinois and oklahoma tulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california has a similiar lab setup for physicians reading this post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that has just been published feb by mosby i have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeutics a little brown series book as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more to residency training two m d s have written this new clinical nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient s nutritional status let me quote a few sentences from the preface of this new text so called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the united states require no formal instruction in nutrition but times and medical practice have changed more than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system roland l weinsier md drph lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause is often a time when women suffer depression there are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified there are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on if you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under clia the clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis nutritionist iv and other software programs but there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the u s and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and

       " ' re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy heart access digex com g writes hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every weeks for the past few months i m at week and during the last visits i ve gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands i ve thus far gained pounds also she says that though i m at weeks the baby s size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the baby s size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here

base runners are good outs are bad and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded you are thinking things like it s a team game so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual players perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field after all perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it therefore i could be an extremely valuable player did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays victory probably but how do you know if you replace him with andres galarraga perhaps the jays would have won perhaps they would have lost perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid season had winfield been dhing for toronto was babe ruth a good player he played on some ws winning teams but did he have anything to do with their success it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder weren t it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof now we have observed things about baseball over the years both empirically and by looking at the rulebook it is necessary to score more runs than one s opponent to win the game so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one s opponent from scoring runs are scored while a team is batting and an inning ends after the third out so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year we do use these statistics to predict winners and so do you to make some flat predictions barry bonds will have a higher obp slg than gene larkin this year the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings the tigers will score more runs than the royals but will also give up more i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false and i suspect so would you as a matter of fact i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year given guesses per division and this is certainly better than random chance and almost statistically significant if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods however fuzzy it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally meaningless so how about real life person a robs a service station with two people in it using a automatic pistol gets and is convicted and sentenced for three years person b with a similar criminal record robs a service station with two people in it using a revolver gets and is convicted since they used two different types of handgun are comparisons totally meaningless say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works my cats are always testing this they don t trust me to pay the gravity bill on time you have never dropped a pencil at that exact

king cogsci ucsd edu jonathan king writes perhaps you can give a more recent citation of any player mentioned as a malingerer thanks i guess i don t understand your question i was trying to imply that the accusations of glenn davis malingering were certainly not played up very much still if the whispers reached san francisco it is certainly possible they were stronger elsewhere also it was teammates making the aspersions in any event i know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years but in any case i believe mike lavalliere has been accused of poor work habits and general sloth recently probably not malingering just as he was being released it s interesting that nobody heard much about these problems before if they were so important i have heard sanders called many things as well i have not heard him called lazy given the sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as such exactly so which means his media detractors have had to say other things about him i believe it s a general phenomenon that if writers don t like you they ll find a label that will stick no matter who you are i find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in why writers feel they need to act this way not that this fascinates me that much either uh the original author s point was that black and white players were por trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected list to prove his case sanders name showed up eventually i dispute that sanders has ever been called lazy by the media hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc is that good press no but it isn t the total extent of the press he received in pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and spoiled by the local columnists again the actual words used may shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher on the list for non white players at least in my subjective opinion aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken and on teams like the red sox which have been traditionally white nowadays most people think of carl yastrzemski as one of those blue collar hard working guys but in the early s he was often portrayed as a lazy bum really hmm i never heard anyone accuse canseco of being lazy nor sierra i ve heard accusations that canseco was a bad fielder but could be a great one if he put his mind to it ignoring whether or not he is a actually dave stewart is was one of the most vocal about this in any event that is not lazy at least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the canseco is lazy issue so i think your point is at best a quibble and probably weaker than that uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first it is not a quibble then to state that the media did not portray canseco as being lazy if the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not make it a quibble and in fact the media around here tend ed to play up his time in the wieght room hardly lazy and hardly a quibble have you ever seen any mediot portray canseco as lazy unconcerned with his fielding yes lazy no bad fielder i think this is still interesting for that matter i think canseco s colorful off field antics get lots more national attention than those of say roger clemens well he s had a few more of them at least more that you ve heard about i think one of the questions here surrounds selective reporting having said that i have to say that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be unfalsifiable at least by those of us who aren t reporters police or private investigators well canseco has been involved in several felonies including his high speed record carrying concealed fire arms and of course the domestic violence clemens had a run in at a bar canseco had that as well and in both cases the coverage was relatively minimal puckett stewart jackson i said over represent non whites three anecdotal data points don t make an interesting counter argument btw which jackson are we talking about here reggie bo darrin danny or uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal and it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own stats than for the good of the team it also seems to me that you re kirby puckett i have never heard this accusation made of puckett i have heard it of boggs actually i believe it of him but that s another matter not living in minnesota i can t say whether or not this line has ever been used against kirby there as far as boggs goes i m not sure why you bring him up since he s one of the obvious prototypes for the line i quoted along with ted williams rod carew and many others uh yes and i agree with your assesment of boggs rather specifically however you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of selfishness i have not ever anywhere heard this said of puckett pendleton either similarly brett b williams and others how about daryl strawberry and i think the plus or minus refers more to the born again types ie butler and gaetti again you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes on the other hand my argument by is of the because jon says so variety if we have no other data i have to admit i have problems generating lists of non white players who became in famous for their religious or political beliefs while names like butler gaetti dravecky knepper hersheiser et al come rolling out there are others perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the case of the born again types i mention mike',\n",

joseph askew writes please cite specific examples where an arab party member was rejected while a jewish party member was accepted if you look at the bottom of this article you will see that i have very kindly dug up one of yigal arens previous postings entirely without his permission i hope he doesn t mind containing translations from ha arezt detailing just such a case perhaps you think that ha arezt lies would you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise never occurs if you examine these i am sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power base that his jewish counterpart had right arabs have been voting in israel for how long and in all that time not one arab ever gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow party members to put in a ministry this is about as likely as sprouting wings and flying to rio what basis do you have for explaining this odd failure you seem very confident that you are right exactly how do you know why are you sure once again if for arguments sake all the arab israelis were to vote for labor at the next election you can rest assured that the number of arab mks and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the power shift exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the labour party has never put an arab into a cabinet post and insists its coalition members do the same why and on what basis are you reassuring me in the face of years of discriminatory practise you are overlooking the fact that they wield political power as individuals based upon a wider collective power base hey what as i said even when their party puts them up they get knocked back it surely couldn t be because they are arabs is it the reasoning i see at work is purely political as far as security goes i think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing jews as well e g sharon well yes but security is the reason most often given by people who want to make excuses i merely thought it would crop up and so pre empted it start of article all commets in are mine not dr arens comments in square brackets are mine yigal from the other front july translation of ha aretz article racism in the knesset coalition requirements on one hand and the presence of progressive mks from meretz in the coalition on the other have compelled rabin and his friends to change to some extent their attitude towards the arab public and their representatives in the knesset although he did refuse to view them as partners taking part in the coalition and joining the government he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intentions which included a commitment to work towards a decrease in the discrimination between jewish and arab citizens decrease what but posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist at all is rabin too a closet self hater yigal however racism has not disappeared when the knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees a request was made to put an mk from hadash the communist party one of the arab parties yigal on the state comptroller s committee and oh did that ever stir up a storm including in the ranks of labor since many knesset members find it unthinkable that an arab mk sit on one of the important house committees security secrets are liable to fall into their hands this attitude which until recently had not even aroused criticism being so natural and so deeply embossed upon people s hearts holds that there are knesset members who despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of israel we are not speaking here of political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but of racial discrimination the proof one of the compromises proposed was that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replaced by tamar gojanski a jew yigal from the same party it was not the member s party which was considered unfit but his race here is a documented case in a respected israeli newspaper it is worth noting that for the first time since the state s founding a public debate has arisen on this subject as witness the following article a test of self confidence by gid on levi ha aretz july revelations of discrimination against arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them do you hear that please contact this levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about israel please yigal except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government s window dressing and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious last week provided two more such examples the israeli knesset is finding it very difficult to allow arab representation on its more important committees and israel television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to arabs from the territories seemingly two entirely different matters but in fact they are one and the same the th knesset proved last week that even though one third of its members are new faces it has not renewed its own face at all at least on one issue parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete and only one tradition endures forever no arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house there has never been and never will be an arab mk on the external affairs and defense committee or on the finance committee worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not to give arabs for the first time a place on the state comptroller s committee the arguments are old and well known in all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed and woe unto us if an arab should hear them one must not make light of such arguments but their significance should also not be exaggerated every arab mk is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the knesset committee room to black panther headquarters in jenin and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top secret matters which could safely be revealed for example to mks supportive of the jewish underground but not to an arab mk from the likud labor or even from hadash the arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the subcommittee on secret service matters but what would happen one may ask if mk nawaf masalha were to hear god forbid a review of the foreign minister in an open meeting of the foreign affairs and defense committee or even a review of the army chief of staff which in any case are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news and what would happen if mk hashem mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al najah their non participation in important committees and that of their colleagues creates an intolerable situation where arab members of the elected house have only semi positions they are good enough for addressing plenary sessions and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the immigration and absorption committee but they must not for example participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the finance committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities in any case they have little part in that labor s dependence on the support of the arab parties has brought about some improvement mk hashem mahamid will it seems participate in the state comptroller s committee earlier there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to hadash who their representative should be and thus to prevent the arab from entering this dubious holy of holies but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices the new committee chair roni milo has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee thus he will decide where it is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not a solution such as this could by the way also have been adopted for the rest of the committees thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the knesset end article do you accept that as

with the exception that i don t preach ignoring our cultures the body as a whole must be unified the question is shall we be a melting pot boiling ourselves down to one legitimate expression or shall we be more like a stew maintaining the textural integrity of the expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought it released all churches from the use of the latin mass unity to allow them to speak to the people in the common language diversity in revelation we see that in the first century church there was one congregation in each major city so there was one unified church now in each city there were people of different cultures naturally they formed something of a stew with different members having different heritages nevertheless they were one body they met together sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts now in a particular city then and now you will find that there is a common language associated with that region for instance in rome latin was spoken in the united states today english is spoken so it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily latin naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language in the first century church there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups today however you don t see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons even in so called pentacostal churches we do have a modern day equivalent though bi lingual speakers now in the unified church of which i am a member sometimes called the international churches of christ when we all meet together on sundays there are headphones on people who don t speak english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue neat idea huh now we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish speaking people for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language in addition we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals so someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language assuming the congregation is large enough for those meetings as for the people who speak the common language they can keep in touch with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of latin indeed not see my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article however if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted i ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping rather i believe it has been enhanced for paul exhorts us to become as one of them that we might reach them thus if a person or group of people feel more comfortable among their own shall we not give them a place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still l ove god my guess aaron you have met some needs of people certainly by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn t yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality christian friendships outside your nationality and your denomination we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage however we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity but rather encourages friendships among all disciples this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions but they are going about things in the wrong way and names like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe although not as much as before i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed but now we should try to unite i know that it s hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth but it is quite possible and i am working to make it happen however what might be a smaller step towards unity would be taking the word african out of your denomination s name then perhaps someday a long time off you can also remove the methodist episcopal part also and simply be part of the church with regard to inclusivity i note tht your sig emits from mit as you know the tute is religiously and culturally diversified and not everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with english much less american culture what shall be the conduct of the campus churches then shall there be one church for the sake of unity or shall the organizations like kcf be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought there shall be one church for the sake of unity and it shall be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought we shouldn t make a new denomination to try to solve problems the whole denominational mindset only causes more problems sadly in the ame church we retain african cutlure at the root of our expression but we are by no means exclusive since you live in cambridge i invite you to visit the local assembly there thank you for the invitation that shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage thank you also for responding to my post i know all too well how they can be very time consuming the whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time my own church the boston church has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post yet doesn t limit expression of my mexican culture even though i am in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish speaking zone i have made a commitment to god that i will go to the sunday services of my church because i know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for god as his disciples i don t believe in tongues as you may have already picked up on because of my understanding of biblical christianity however i am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn t interfere with my normal worship since you also live in cambridge i also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like you can meet the mit students at the student center across from mass ave at am on sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day my number is but will be in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer our service normally last from am to noon but occasionally are later or earlier times per year let us always strive to reach all with the gospel by any means necessary as we move from milk to meat the petty things of the world that temporally separate us will dissolve away and we shall stand with our naked realizations that god has shed his grace on all of us his delightful creation definitely let s also strive to grow in obedience to the lord through being men and women after god s own heart aaron bryce cardenas net net mit

ground station hardware problems but the one on april was successfully performed on april a cruise science memory readout mro was performed for the magnetometer mag instrument analysis indicates the data was received properly on april the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence these relays were commanded closed by the cds command data subsystem prior

mro were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer euv dust detector dds and magnetometer mag instruments preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly during the period from april to april a navigation cycle was performed this navigation cycle provided near continuous acquisition of two way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over

on less i argue that by having all property tied up and thus cutting people off form the basic level of subsistance that the property owners must bribe the rest of us to respect their ownership rights by providing alternative means of subsistance when we are expected to give these peoperty owners lets call them thieves bribes in order to be able to subsists then we have a sick situation the property owners are then parasites i want people to be able to live happy and prosperous lives property owners cannot maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unless they have help from a coercive government when a few land owners get together and try to control all the land without selling land prices will go up at some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner to sell some of his property trying to put a group of people to distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the land and would have the consequences you speak of let s keep the land out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market it s already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism of land other than government land saved for posterity and the eco system as well as government function the remaining land is owned by a smaller percentage of the people than ever before the game of capitalism is almost won the game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly or else be enslaved in return for a place to live here in central california already fewer than own all the property and of them own of it that s twice what it was twenty years ago rents are so high that you pay of your income for rent if you just have a mcjob all you can afford is one room if that some of minimum wage workers are homeless unless you both have degrees in technical fields and are working in them in the midst of unemployment in high tech jobs you will never own anything but a used car if you choose to have more than one child and everywhere else you could afford there are no jobs the only way to get there is to save and not consume any more than you have to clothing used food poor no movies no entertainment ect for about five to seven years and then if you ve saved if you can get together that much and that s ignoring your kids and working two jobs then you can buy a home in arkansas or missouri outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year that s an exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other people s houses and find a sturdy hill then you can buy one up there also buy a rowboat missouri s not so bad if you like the sensation of sleeping in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter they really do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to start with ether shit kill the rich and redistribute the livable property kill all of them rsw i want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more is there a workable system for what you suggest i am always looking for improvements on the way we can coexist in this world and will give people happy meaningful lives where each individual can reach their highest potential are you asking for the forced redistribution of land any system i imagine will lead to unfairnes pollution over popullation and land mismanagement if you know of such a system please describe it please be specific since my imagination cannot comprehend such a system specifics that i am interested in does someone get land assigned them when they are born what happens to someone s land when they die can they pass it on to their children can someone sell land can someone leaase their land what governmental restrictions will be put on land use who will administer such a system how much will it cost to administer such a system i know that this is alot to ask and will understand if you do not have the time to answer these questions i think i will be better able to understand what you are proposing if you can answer these quesitons paul schmidt advocates for self government davy crockett chapter president the land is simply granted to people who live on it now extra is kept for the future you get to stay where you are without paying rent land that supports others becomes property of the state farmers are welcome to plant crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality if you want to grow sourgum because you always did and you aren t doing a good job then we let another farmer grow sorghum and you grow something else when people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the public holdings no one can sell land but they can trade places with anybody no one can lease land the government will locally distribute the use of the land not used for residences residences that are insufficient to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house and yard according to need and availability the local land council who vow to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness subject to review by the state and federal land councils it

it isn t so hard to think of a better system than we have all you have to do is realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct in fact it s a rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could be already the trick is to realize that the old rich have been making the rules behind your back and that it s time to kick them off the merry go round tax the rich to death they are the ones that converted your s school lunch program into the joke it is today they are the ones who always cut education they are the ones who always raise the rent when you get a raise they are the ones who should be not just dislodged but killed for their abuse i have trouble justifying the death penalty for a poor kid who killed and didn t know why not i have no trouble justifying the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed their greed have you paid rent most of your life then you have been enslaved percentage wise most of your life we used to be serfs

       " ' experiences with dos i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copies my apologies here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos as an upgrade distribution it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos that i have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it my envorinment ti travelmate winsx sx m ram m disk system bios version by texas instruments cl gd vga bios v a by cirrus logic quadtel advance power manager battery pro v b by texas instruments smart drive cache win dos parameters a b windows benchmark winbench tm v by zd labs after updgrading to dos i could not understand why certain things became so slow especially after i decided to try dblspace in the process of finding out why i discovered some interesting things disk performance with double space and smart drive while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applications appeared to run very much slower what was interesting is that commands like chkdsk and defrag were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards i suspected double space ds and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbench tm the real disk winmark of for the original system as shipped from factory with dos and windowws became when upgraded to dos with ds thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something specifically for short sequential reads up to bytes ds actually improves transfer rates by about because cpu being faster than i o more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in i o cycles however for all other cases particularly large random writes the transfers take up to three times as long while the performance depends on the type of access i e random or sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on winbench s assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed the tests alone done in real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like there is no noticable difference in performance or even that it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk i o this explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why chkdsk and defrag the latter especially too so long double space and windows dblspace will not run at all from within windows not even if you wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on its usage try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get how narrow minded can a programer get i wonder yes this information can be obtained through the mstools dd add on to file manager but this mstools dll does not understand a compressed floppy use the dos supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to dos defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm defragmentation seemed to take too much time even so i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation dblspace def command for the m drive should take no more than seconds much faster on other defragmenters i have used but it took minutes i discovered that if i moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran faster the figure ticked more rapidly it dawned on me that this had to do with ti s battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process after disabling the ti s power saver this operation took only seconds microsft programmers think ti and gateway nomad users are idiots in the readme txt file you can find the the following running microsoft backup with ti and gateway nomad computers to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for windows or ms dos add a l switch to the device command in your config sys that loads the battery pro file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower l at the command prompt if you checked ti s manual on the l option you will realise that it means disable all power saving features of your notebook why would anyone want to run a driver disabled as i have found out not only does ti s power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readme txt claims but chkdsk and dblspace and who knows what else are crippled by the ti s power saver it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications if there indeed is such a thing then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots by the way if you run the advance power management utility power exe in dos when you check the status it says power management status setting adv max cpu idle of time this figure of seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing windows with only program manager in iconised form does that mean that windows takes up of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only left for useful work is such an overhead justified whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface in dos alone it reports idle time looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical negative example of our times microsoft programmers do not know batch programming i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this set path c dos set path c etc bin path c bin set path c etc windows path c windows set path path c bcc bin set path path mouse even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one i e c dos dos installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends c dos to its value as a result my resultant path has so many dos s if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path and add the new dos path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being upgraded instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process i started a thread on this when dos came up and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet now that has not changed one bit in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming i had the mouse driver invoked as set mouse c etc mouse set path path mouse loadhigh mouse mouse com guess what memmaker did it replaced the last statement with lh c etc mouse mouse com why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters without touching the rest of the line i do not understand dos software quality dos is the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it i am deliberately being cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this ghost file surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of their products i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested but can only be built into the product no wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair also if you run dblspace def often enough repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the defragmenters i got my io sys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since microsft dont

       " ' waco questions folks it s time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local tv radio and newprint media ideally these questions could be asked at any investigation into the batf s and fbi s participation at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and hopefully wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the batf and fbi my list is up to that are really nagging at my gut the list will probably grow what were the contents of the original warrant now sealed that the batf obtained it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and or ammunition could not be flushed down the toilet therefore a no knock raid could be ruled out prior to the initial assault on the complex did a single batf agent and accompanying witness without a contingent of assault and news media personnel attempt to knock on the door of the branch davidian s complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law on the day of the initial assault on the complex batf agents were aware that several small children were inside the buildings in the ensueing gun battle batf agents fired into a building known to contain children killing at least one two year old child knowing children were present why didn t the batf have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over in firearms and ammunition did david koresh and the members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms license were they actively participating in the legal business of selling buying firearms and ammunition and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons after the original assault on the compound tragically failed a batf spokeswoman stated we were outgunned yet tv newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents armed with mp and ar m rifles although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent s bodies they also may have had ak and sks rifles what type s of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily why did the fbi treat it as a hostage situation along the same lines why did the fbi use psychological warfare techniques including sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out why did the fbi expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch davidians setting fire to the complex branch davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide yet bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex this seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history what evidence does the fbi have that a mass suicide pact existed fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the branch davidian s ammunition and or powder cache exploding yet the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes was any evidence found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition and or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball if so and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter s car which had been left at the compound is there any factual basis to this rumor and if so what charges will be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act fbi director sessions states that during the final assault on the complex over shots were fired at the vehicles on the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines yet there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired also there are no indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows buildings or other structures in the video surely these should be evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles finally the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high power rifles cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent the united states has signed international treaties which prevent the use of cs gas in warfare if the united states could not morally use cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land on april fbi spokesmen state that at least bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide on april the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the

jbs rti rti org writes in article bb ba a r vmcms csuohio edu r vmcms csuohio edu writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents if you re a research associate in urban child research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the u s is a serious problem firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends any death is serious wanna discuss match control firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the gun did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent no i hate to repeat myself jim but like i told joe i was not attempting in any way to justify gun control you re right any death is serious that was my point to joe who said that anti gunners try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem no i don t want to discuss match control i don t equate a book of matches to a loaded millimeter either don t confuse the issue and please don t say that tired old nra line guns don t kill people people kill people sure people can kill people without guns but easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient guns don t kill people people with easy access to guns kill people more than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful providing false hope then is the intent jim i m just saying how it is i m not saying if that is a good thing or not from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs i get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community when i ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program they say well no so in answer to your question no false hope is not the intent i think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not look if you can t measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test evaluation what is the point it must be symbolic in nature the police are essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you don t want it we ll give you for it because we care about the community if you i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics increase in california schools eh gun control is working fine there i didn t anything about gun control what are you talking about thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger holding kids time for a reality check son these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive thanks for the reality check joe its been real so your religion is

       " ' re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction in article rhfrkinn shelley u washington edu nodrog hardy u washington edu gordon rubenfeld writes banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med dec p psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost candida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene and a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely like it is in animal husbandry marty b',\n",

their smaller invasion i lived in the west and i have seen how your media prepared you helpless naive americans for a war against no doubt you plan on exploiting helpless naive americans for your own purposes hmm let s see iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that led to the invasion as the cia correctly predicted and pretended to be surprised not to know it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid what would i have done most muslims would choose dead kuwaitis over dead iraqis and dead kuwaitis the first case would happen if no western intervention happened and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement possibly if iraqis had indeed died but this number is based on greenpeace estimates greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of allied miiltary action while initially completely ignoring iraq s horrible environmental crimes starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the gulf at ahmadi to the blowing of over oil wells what is the real number there has been a lot of work on this in the last two years none of it reported as the greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about the real number seems to be around on the same order as the number of kuwaitis killed tortured and kidnapped during the occupation i ve included an article i recently posted below but this is really old news independent television news reported a figure around only a few months after the war but it was hardly reported for the allies to have killed iraqis they would have had to kill twice the total number of iraqis in kuwait the favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at mutla this was yet another example of the american and european media playing into the hands of iraq and its de facto allies the destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla was portrayed as an all out slaughter this is simply not true the head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially resulting in a lot of casualties at these points before bombers came back most of the rest of the iraqi soldiers fled on foot furthermore your estimates of kuwaiti war dead if allies hadn t invaded is completely ridiculous you have acknowledged certainly implicitly that saddam is a barbarous brute you have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing in his own country you know that the man he appointed as governor of kuwait ali majid was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide of the kurds in the late s and more recently the shi a yet when it comes to his treatment of kuwaitis he is an angel in your estimate he would ve killed fewer than he already had when the war started what a joke apn iraq war dead copyright the associated press all rights reserved by nick ludington associated press writer washington ap after the persian gulf war ended the world was told that as many as iraqi soldiers were killed at one point even baghdad put the toll that high as did the u s defense intelligence agency in private but u s officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public now one former dia analyst says the number of iraqi troops killed may have been as low as that conclusion by john heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine foreign policy represents the lowest estimate yet from u s defense sources the revisions suggesting a less devastating iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated u s military claims in the months after the war ended claims for a number of u s weapons also were scaled down despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of iraq s disastrous retreat from kuwait arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the gulf war heidenrich is not the first to question the iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired more that a year ago air force lt gen charles horner the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war said he believed the iraqi military death toll was fewer than for the entire war the pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of iraqis who died in the day war against the u s led coalition in january and february on monday pentagon spokesman lt cmdr joe gradisher reiterated past statements that there just isn t a number that is credible but some current internal estimates range from to iraqi troops killed said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity who is familiar with the pentagon s reports allied deaths were put at americans by friendly fire british by american fire frenchmen italian and among various arab allies of the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the army s reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against iraq s scud missiles the bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the patriot last spring it revised the hit ratio to percent the success record of the navy s tomahawk high tech cruise missile used against targets in baghdad and other parts of iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the pentagon the first iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a may report by the environmental group greenpeace which said to iraqi soldiers were killed it estimated that to iraqi civilians were also killed the same month published reports said the defense intelligence agency estimated iraqi soldiers were killed and wounded in the air and ground campaigns although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as percent in either direction but as more information became available those figures gradually were revised downward the house armed services committee staff estimated dead and wounded after a review last year but heidenrich writing in the current issue of the quarterly foreign policy estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as with about wounded heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by u s troops and on prisoner of war interviews he noted that only about of iraqi prisoners of war were wounded based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured he put the number of wounded at about using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded applicable to third world armies like iraq he set battlefield deaths at maybe the figures are too low he wrote maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was or or even even then the evidence suggests a death toll of well below or even in an interview he said the figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers in the kuwait theater of operations were casualties he said today s bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology but rather the drawn out conflicts such as those in yugoslavia and somalia',\n",

here we go again you started it for predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless at least if it has meaning we don t know how to find it i did not say i could predict the future you most certainly did non clutch clutch ab h ba ab h ba sabo samuel sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel yet you would pinch hit samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and sabo will be a choke hitter right i d call that predicting the future if you were to have been the reds manager at that time i assume you would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch hitting samuel i m sure some of that basis would have utilized prior performance you just wouldn t have used this particular aspect of prior performance is this not correct right i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past overall performance l r splits even matching hitting pitching styles all of these will give me some advantage if used properly even if all else were equal there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance and in this case everything else pointed to sabo one more time i did not claim to be able to predict the future i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo that comes down to the same thing when perez left sabo in he was predicting the future the next ab he was predicting that sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel by supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite and i am not dismissing your work i m stating my opinion you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult to your work well yes you are aware of its existance you claim to be incapable of understanding it though i suspect you are simply unwilling yet you rather forcefully state the opposite you don t seem to think the work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important i d say this is insulting i did not say that it is a consistent skill i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a certain set of circumstances right this is the beef it has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under any circumstances at least none that we ve been able to come up with if you know of some where it is an indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret it is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility that you actually could have some preconceived biases most certainly as i have repeatedly stated if you can come up with a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability i would love it however the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably yeah hindsight is always doesn t that make you bright this is a stupid argument and you know it ah i knew we could get to the name calling and there s that word you like so much well it was a stupid argument are you honestly debating that sure we know sabo didn t get a hit we have no idea whether samuel would have done any better or not one ab most certainly doesn t prove anything i believe that by season s end that chris sabo s batting average in clutch situations will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch situations i can t prove that it will happen so i guess we ll just have to wait and see is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit xxx amount worse in the clutch than overall if you mean the first then as you say we ll just have to wait and see but the second is a much stronger statement in fact it suggests a rule we can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years i think you will agree that if the rule didn t work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do any better this year right here s another one for you in joe carter s batting average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting average in non clutch situations each year i presume you think this is random i m not going to get into case analysis sure you can find somebody who hit poorly from and then hit poorly in as well you can also find those who hit poorly from and then hit well in no this doesn t prove any overall statistical trend that can be used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers it just makes me think that in joe carter s batting average in the clutch is not going to be as high as his ba in non clutch situations gambler s fallacy unless there is reason to expect consistency a run proves nothing can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to correlate from one year to the next i ve seen a detailed study of why i shouldn t expect it to correlate stupid total idiot my my such hostility the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid and i don t see how you can deny it as for total idiot yes if you prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might suggest that you are wrong i would say the term fits nicely so tell me does the term fit or do

a term i employed to avoid the awkward construction girlfriend or wife because if she heard thankfully you got the gender right for i am not a deviant a deviant is someone who does not fit an accepted norm by that definition i would certainly be a deviant as bisexuality is not an accepted norm in american society so far this term of course really has no negative aspects inherent in its denotation i presume you intended it as a term of abuse it s a great pity you feel such tactics to be necessary but hardly surprising since you have no factual basis for your absurd beliefs how disparaging you are towards political minorities sexual deviants do not comprise a political minorit y may i attempt to emulate your style of discourse with a term of abuse ahem you addle pated jellyfish the post to which i responded was a highly amusing one in which you belittled homosexuals for having no political clout i would be further amused if you would explain to me why having no political clout and constituting a political minority are different and if she had any shred of self respect she d be out the door i only associate with girls who do indeed have self respect but were and yet you call them girls the feminists would be up in arms i to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as homosexuality i would encourage her to indeed do so and i would further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on the way out who needs such an airhead cough cough well well you certainly are a fine upstanding fellow you are sir and like many fine upstanding fellows you have the reading comprehension of a dyslexic anteater perhaps i should have been more explicit in pointing out that females constitute a political minority in this country when last i checked and that your obvious lack of respect for these minorities equates to a lack of respect for women that is of course a conceptual stretch of logic but given your slow uptake as de monstrated so far i figure we should start simple and work up don t worry you ll get it pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet where they belong don t count on it sweetheart oh i can t do anything but count on it after all it is inevitable for it is part of the natural order of things throughout history nature has always asserted itself don t be so arrogant as this is very true this bit about nature asserting itself homosexuality has always been a part of human society and always will be for that is the natural order if you re naive enough to believe otherwise go right ahead we ll try not to snicker too loudly behind your back inevitable chortle anyone would think you had some idea what you were talking

beyond the donna reed show live a little and then come back and tell us all about the natural order of things you re in a bubble and it s really going to rock your world when you come out to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the nature of man where practically every other generation has failed foolish and misguided oh this is too much so which religious figure do you believe you are and how do you know so much about the nature of man you re almost too amusing to be worth the effort of crushing your pealike brain greater men than you haven t been able to do this

shitless that what you ve been spoonfed all your sorry little life was wrong and you re trying to escape that fear by a blind faith that you know deep down is based in nothing nothing at all go ahead

president has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now including ones that weren t there before and i think he s as is everybody gravely concerned about the situation in bosnia q is he influenced by that i mean how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area those desk officers ms myers many of the specialists in that area i think that that is clearly part of the process it s something their views will clearly be considered i think secretary christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views i think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered particularly from people who work closely on the issues q what do you mean there are options on the table that weren t there before ms myers i think the president said last week that there were options such as lifting the arms embargo to the bosnian muslims that had been previously off the table that are now being considered q dee dee in terms of those options madeleine albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the u s if the europeans did not go along is that on the table ms myers well i can t discuss anything that would any conversations that would have happened between ambassador albright and the president but i think the president has said he would certainly is working with our european allies he s had a number of conversations with european leaders and is trying to build some consensus there q will he reach a decision will he have anything specific to say today ms myers no i mean in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today q does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action ms myers he s continuing to consult with our allies at this point he has said i think he s been fairly clear about it that the he believes that the u s needs to act in concert with its allies on this q on that point does he believe that the u s though does have built in authority from the united nations already to take unilateral action ms myers well i think the u n resolution makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort i think the broader point is that anything we do any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with u n authority and if it s not we ll work with our allies to make sure that we get it q dee dee then how does the white house someone as distinguished as elie wiesel who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in bosnia ms myers i think that that s why we re considering additional options i think that mr wiesel s comments yesterday were quite compelling the situation in bosnia is tragic the president is very concerned about it he has i think president clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate serbia in the world community clearly we re considering other options because the president is concerned that perhaps it s not enough q in terms of what you were just talking about it sounds like resolution justifies unilateral action by the u s to protect humanitarian ms myers i don t think it i wouldn t use the word justify it permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief but i think that s just an explanation of the resolution i think any action that we take will be consistent with u n resolutions or we ll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we ll get further action q the president and other officials have ruled out unilateral u s action in bosnia in the past you re declining to do that this morning ms myers no i said the president has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this q that doesn t mean that he won t act alone which has been said before explicitly ms myers i don t mean to imply a change in policy the president has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this q one other little question did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers ms myers i don t believe so secretary christopher they may have had a private conversation about it the president has not seen it q they met on monday right christopher met surely he must have brought that up ms myers again they may have talked privately about it but q dee dee what you re saying is that the albright recommendation has been rejected is that correct ms myers no i didn t say that at all i said i won t i said i wouldn t comment on any conversations or communications q she s advocating unilateral action and you re saying in effect that we will not take unilateral action ms myers i am not confirming anything that madeleine albright may or may not have recommended q given the sometimes delicate complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue does the president find this kind of letter from foreign service officers of the state department helpful to that process hurtful to that ms myers i think that their views are obviously being considered the secretary received that memo on saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views of the basis for their views to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter q doesn t it put some kind of pressure on additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do ms myers i think clearly there s a broad policy review underway now and the president and his advisors are considering a number of options including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the state department now no decisions have been made on that yet but i think that there is a through review underway and that their opinions are being very seriously considered q if i can just follow up i guess what i m looking for is what was his reaction to this letter did he say good this bolsters my position or did he say damn this is just what i don t need right now ms myers i think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate it s important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible and this i think in many ways furthers that goal q so internal advice to a cabinet official or the president it s all open now and you wouldn t take any umbrage or say that they were out of line ms myers i think that the fact that secretary christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome q does the policy review include what madeleine albright has suggested and what joe biden and others have suggested which is that the previous u n resolutions authorize unilateral action military action for the delivery of humanitarian ms myers i think all options are on the table q the unilateral option is on the table ms myers i think all options are on the table q we ve had two different q isn t that a change dee dee q that would be a change of policy q particularly if it includes ground troops which has been specifically ruled out ms myers i think the president has been well no i don t that is not q are you talking about all options ms myers all options i think the president has been fairly clear about that so let me just review again what he has said he has said that the president has said all options are on the table with the exception of the introduction of ground troops which he has never suggested he has ruled that out from the beginning q hasn t he ruled out unilateral action of any sort ms myers he has said that he doesn t believe the u s can solve the problems in the former yugoslavia by itself i think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now i don t think that again i don t want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we ve already said things like lifting the arms embargo against the bosnian muslims things that i think we ve talked about in broad terms this is a very complicated situation the options being presented and considered are very complicated q air strikes on the table ms myers again i think that s been fairly clearly pointed out that that s something that s being discussed q dee dee are ground troops on the ms myers no ground troops are not being considered q you said there was not going to be you said you were not announcing a change of policy then you said everything is on the table we re confused are unilateral actions on the table ms myers all i can tell you is what the president has said that he doesn t believe that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this q wants to but he s willing to i mean if they don t go along ms myers he s continuing to consult with our allies on this he s continuing to have discussions he s continuing to press them for further action and i think that s clear the conversation is ongoing we re going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this q dee dee the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the bosnians ms myers i m not sure that s the consistent i mean i m not sure who you re referring to q the british and the french q yes the british and french they ve taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the bosnian military does the u s believe differently from that ms myers the president has had conversations with both mitterrand and major as you know i think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well and i don t want to comment on the nature of the president s discussions other than to say that he s continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he s continuing to press them for further action and i think that process is ongoing q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday does the president regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action the allies have been very very plain that they do not want to do anything ms myers the consultations are ongoing that s all i can tell you at this point q are you saying that there won t be any announcement on bosnia today in the press conference ms myers no that is not the intention of the press conference q what is the intention ms myers it s an opportunity to take questions he may have a brief i m sure he ll have a brief opening statement but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnia that will not happen q can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is ms myers it s sort of a general statement of where we are q after the first hundred days you mean ms myers it s not a long statement i mean this is just generally don t look for any major policy pronouncements q do you know what the opening statement is ms myers but it s perhaps later today i ll be able to tell you with more certainty i think that s still under review but the overriding purpose of this it s not a mystery it s not meant to be it s just to take questions q it would be helpful to know whether what the opening statement is on ms myers since the major purpose here is just to take questions it s not completely resolved yet q dee dee one policy that was expected last week and that the white house you and george seemed to indicate we might get would be an aids czar will he announce that today and what s the delay on that ms myers i don t think we meant to imply i think we said it would happen soon i don t think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week it is coming soon i don t anticipate that happening today q what s the delay isn t this the perfect time to announce an aids czar ms myers i don t know that it s a delay i think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks and to make sure that we ve crossed the t s and dotted the i s before we make an announcement q dee dee what are zoe baird s qualifications for the foreign intelligence advisory board and why wasn t her appointment announced here ms myers the qualifications i don t know if there s a specific list i ll have to check and see i think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service i think there s a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there we never made a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board which is admiral william crowe q why would he appoint her though if the american people and many in the senate rejected her for another government job ms myers i don t believe that the american people ever had voted on her and i certainly she was never rejected in the senate she never went up there for a hearing but the president believes she s a very competent person he s said that zoe baird do you understand what the question is zoe baird is on the president s foreign intelligence q you said she never went up there for a hearing q her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws ms myers right she never she was never but you said she was rejected by the senate i was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the senate q so you don t think that is any problem ms myers i don t think there s any problem q she has been appointed to this board is that a fact ms myers yes q does she need confirmation for this does she need confirmation to be a member of the ms myers no it s a presidential appointment q usually announcements are made here at the white house was there a decision not to announce her publicly ms myers we didn t make an announcement people who asked were told who the members of the board were we didn t make an official announcement if anybody s interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names q i d like to know q don t such board members don t you normally as a matter of routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension ms myers not always but again i m happy to put this out q isn t that the standard practice q that was past practice ms myers again i m happy to put it out we ll put out a list of the members of the board today q dee dee i don t want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but laughter all i really want to know is hasn t it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely ms myers i think generally but not always and we re happy to put that out today q what is the board what is her title what is the size of the board ms myers there is roughly a dozen members on the board it is a civilian board although their are some obviously retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the president again the chairman of that board is admiral william crowe q and did he recommend baird q what s the name of the board ms myers it s the president s foreign intelligence advisory board pfiab q what s her qualification that she had employed an illegal alien is that laughter ms myers do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke q let me phrase it another way why shouldn t this appointment be viewed as a pay back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago ms myers because it s not q what s her experience in foreign intelligence ms myers she s an experienced attorney someone who the president believes is very competent and qualified and i think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert that is not the board s mission it is to provide civilian input for the president as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters he believes she s very qualified very competent person enormously talented and has said that throughout q is this just a figment of my overactive imagination or was there discussion early on about abolishing the president s foreign intelligence advisory board ms myers i don t think so on december th when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would had appointed admiral crowe as the head of the board so i don t believe there s ever been any q earlier than that during the transition ms myers no i don t believe so it was announced again on december th admiral crowe couldn t be there but it was announced q are members paid ms myers i don t believe so but i ll double check q on another subject on waco how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of waco and the state i guess it s the texas ranger reports ms myers most of the information is coming the federal information is coming from the site clearly there s been some discrepancies and the justice department is looking into it officials in the justice department were told i believe the day before yesterday that there were several bodies found with bullet holes i think there s some discrepancy about that and the justice department is looking into it q is the president going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there with some people withdrawing others saying they re in charge but others justice fbi texas rangers all grabbing a piece of this ms myers i don t know that he s going to try to mediate the dispute i mean i ll let you know if there s anything he intends to do about it but as you know there are several levels of investigation ongoing and we re hopeful that they can work together q is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything ms myers i don t know i ll have to get back to you on that q what is the subject matter of sunday s speech ms myers it s going to be fairly general i don t think it s going to be any specific announcements i think it s going to be sort of a q does he have a topic that he s going to talk about ms myers we re still working on it but i wouldn t look for any announcements of like the drug czar or something like that q is it sort of a days speech sort of my excellent adventure for days laughter ms myers not exactly but i think he ll take a little bit broader look about what s happened in the last q foreign domestic ms myers a little bit of both but i think a lot of domestic q and overview ms myers yes more of an overview than a specific policy announcement q has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the president will address the gay rights march on sunday ms myers it will be a letter read to the crowd by congresswoman nancy pelosi q is that available ms myers not yet but it will be sure q are you going to put it out here or ms myers we ll probably put it out here on sunday q travel next week ms myers unclear q what was the question q likely ms myers i don t q likely possible ms myers possible q what s possible ms myers travel q george mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week do you have days yet for them ms myers not yet q can you tell us which order ms myers campaign finance reform first national service later in the week q is there any coverage tomorrow in williamsburg ms myers no q and any report in the aftermath of the day ms myers any readout from the day q readout ms myers it s possible jeff eller will be down there i think he can go through what the president did during the day we don t expect any photo op or anything other than departure here in the morning q dee dee the president has not made a regular practice as some of his predecessors have of going to camp david in fact he s been there what once or twice ms myers twice q why this weekend ms myers he went two weekends ago as you know on the way home from his father in law s funeral i think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family and this is just an opportunity to do the same q there s no march there q it has nothing to do with the march here ms myers no q since he s going to be in town sunday morning now instead of in jamestown have you thought about him making a quick pass by fly over laughter ms myers he ll fly straight to boston q flying straight did you say laughter q george took a question yesterday on waco the president had said on tuesday in the rose garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the fbi and the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas do you have an answer on that ms myers i don t i ll check the press thank you end a m edt',\n",

alternatives let s get the government to pay for adoption fees let s get the government to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary why not they are certainly legal procedures counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provides abortion information how about providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is comfortable with your adoption funding idea may be a good one any idea if it is feasable the only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort before i give in to paying for abortions i believe it is wrong and i won t pay for it without a gripe i m not for making them unlawful i d rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court hearings and all this other crap we are spending our time on you know who s really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff lawyers i say let s pass laws to make adoption cheaper easier and infinitely more supportive of the birth mother let s eradicate the stigma reduce the cost pay the price for life making adoption easier on the birth mother may help reduce abortion but it will not eliminate the need for it abortion is not done just because the mother can t care for the child and doesn t feel good about giving it to strangers abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy soapbox off a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights of another person cool enough you ll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement than getting people to agree to it for example i perceive i have a right not to participate in what i feel is murder i don t think the government should either on the other hand since we are having trouble proving that it is murder there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so choose either by legal means or harassment of course persuasion is allowed but watch that line between persuasive and harassing the second part is a definition of a person a simplistic explanation is that a person is a member of society most normal adult human beings are good examples of people most children over two years old are people as well the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation with them it is actually more complicated than that but i have no desire to spend the time it would take to explain it to you read the thread why is bodily autonomy so important for more explanation and justification but why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe us surely you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of consideration then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable and why that includes the unborn if the government refused to fun abortions due to the qualms of a minority of the population then it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose mothers wanted an abortion but could not afford one and now that baby will also require care for years true that needs to be fixed it is part of the problem if clinton has a medical program to get underway let him address this too it is cheaper in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of society at least if his plan works no they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society even if they do that is many years in the future until which they are a burden on someone or society there is also the matter of the mother forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent her from being a productive member of society actually i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion not those who object to federal funding i admit i did not say it very clearly and apologize for that to refuse to fund abortions is to remove that choice from some women and add the additional burden to society for no reason no this is really flawed logic it would be like me saying i was born with a disfigured face and i want cosmetic repair it is discriminatory that i cannot make that choice and so you must pay for it that a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or otherwise that someone else should foot the bill sic for that choice ok look it s like this we are footing the bill maybe they will take choice a maybe they will take choice b maybe they will take choice c they can t afford any one of them if they take choice a we d have to pay them say if they take choice b it would cost us if they take choice c it will cost us now and a hell of a lot more for the next years which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for now some people happen not to like choice a other people happen not to like choice c paying for it that is c has been around and paid for for years even though it means we spend a lot of money we can t in conscience refuse to pay for it now a has been around and is perfectly legal but it hasn t been funded in the past now a is going to be funded but some people object they don t like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice a so we could refuse to fund a at all then those women who can t afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice b or c which will cost all of us more money most of us don t see any reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing personal choice from some women the alternative is to fund a if that is what the mother chooses we will also still fund b and even c if that is what the mother chooses however some women will certainly choose a and that will then save us we otherwise would have had to spend your taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object they are being lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal despite your objections to it actually your taxes are not really going to go down as i m sure you would point out but the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another like our massive debt if you disagree then give us some reasons given that abortion is legal and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the population it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford them who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you would force upon them i refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure what i say objection to the procedure is irrelevant uncle bill doesn t pay for breast augmentation facelifts etc why abortions it s elective surgery those other procedures you mention only cost money there is no savings in other procedures that would be required down the road without them in fact there could be additional costs down the road because of them this is quite different from the case of abortion as for your argument you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too so you are just as guilty of removing a choice by withholding funds think about it a poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded what s she gonna do what choice have your plans given her your kind of double talk really makes me ill this is bullshit we are not refusing to make the alternative affordable too if we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then your statement would make sense but that is not the case so it doesn t if clinton tried to block funding for pre natal care and delivery or left it out of his health care plan i would certainly object i would also be quite surprised pro choice ha pro abortion really fits in your case yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reasons you think if you re gonna fund one choice you have to fund them all at the very least you stupid fuck we do want to fund all the choices you are the one who wants to not fund all the choices imho if we fund the adoption choice right meaning not just throwing money at it but cutting costs esp legal costs we won t need abortion anymore your humble opinion is still wrong even with easy adoption there is still the fact that pregnancy takes several months months in which a young woman could need to be getting an education like finishing high school entering college finishing college getting a job things that are much harder to do if you have to take a break for a few months things that have a massive impact on her future productivity have a right to life a fetus is not a person you can not have a conversation with them ah let s kill the mentally incompetant as well or how about people we just don t like since we can t have a conversation with them you can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant and even though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just don t like it is still possible for others to have a conversation with them it is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with a fetus they are not biologically independent nor was my son at the age of weeks he was breastfed and would not take a bottle just what does biologically independent mean i ll be happy to punch any definition full of loopholes he was still biologically independent at least to the same extent you are now he consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner he breathed his own air a fetus on the other hand gets it s nutrients already digested by the mother it gets its oxygen from the mother as well that is not biologically independent their awareness is questionable aha you admit it is questionable yet you are willing to kill it even if it may be very aware i suggest you re think your viewpoint awareness is only part of what makes a member of society it is the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society i keep asking but i still haven t seen a real justification for why the life of a non sentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient being i haven t read every response on the threads i ve been asking on yet so we ll see if i see

       " ' arsenokoitai continuing part i think used by permission the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b deyoung w petersen more recently wright s understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction in a brief study william petersen found linguistic confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of arsenokoitai he faulted wright and english bible translaions for rendering it by homosexuals in i cor and i tim in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey boswell and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of bailey he finds homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic a major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul s time what is this disjunction he bases it on historical and linguistic facts accordingly ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in describing these actions ancient society know nothing of the categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of dover quoted approvingly by petersen everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli in contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual to desire and propensity k m benkert who in coined the german term equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english dictionary which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts petersen s point is that by using homosexuals for arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history where no equivalent concept existed consequently the translation is inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts and incorrectly includes female homosexuals prior to there was no cognitive structure either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio homosexual is mistaken yet is it possible that petersen is the one mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds the next phases of this paper will critically examine petersen s position the justification for translating arsenokoitai by homosexuals historical grounds a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul s usage no historical settings earlier than his are available yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to present day concepts peterson bailey boswell and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be part of the definition of the term they assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind boswell active male prostitutes scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times bailey petersen the following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the homosexual condition exist before is it only a modern phenomenon yet if it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it indeed evidence show that the ancients pre christian and christian not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of same sex activity transvestism included but also knoew about same sex orientation or condition petersen admits n that plato in symposium d d may be a sole possible exception to ancient ingnorance of this condition he discounts this however believing that even here acts appear to be the deciding factor however this is a very significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile female androgynon man woman hence original nature palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings zeus sliced these human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex plato then quotes aristophances each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him all the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man woman are woman courters our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the she minions men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men s embrasces these are the finest boys and striplings for they have the most manly nature some say they are shameless creatures but falsely for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome their like sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men so when they come to man s estate they are boy lovers and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind well when one of them whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be induced to leave each other s side for a single moment these are they who continue together throughout life though they could not even say what they would have of one another d c should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live or even in hades aristophanes says that each would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time e several observations about this text are in order lesbianism is contemplated as will as male homosexuality e natural interest ton noun physei b refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination the words born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai b reflect the modern claims to be

mankind reassembling our early estate ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus d the concept of permanency these are they who continue together throughout life c is also present further mention of and or allusion to permanecy mutality gay pride pederasty homophobia motive desire passion and the nature of love and its works is recognizable clearly the ancients thought of love homosexual or other apart from actions the speakers in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial money office influence etc bring reproach e a b they mention the need to love the soul not the body e there are tow kinds of love in the body b and each has its desire and passion b d the speakers discuss the principles or matters of love c the desires of love c and being males by nature c noteworthy is the speech of socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects a c desire is felt for what is not provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack this is the object of desire and love socrates clearly distinguishes between what sort of being is love and the works of love e this ancient philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature his wors have significance for more than pederasty in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not inclination or orientation widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction in rom such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires of the heart and reprobate mind prove paul s concern for disposition and inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv even the catologues of vices are introdiced i tim or concluded i cor by words describing what people are or were not what they do habits betray what people are within as also the lord jesus taught cf matt the inner condition is as important as the outer act one gives rise to the other cf mt petersen errs regarding other particulars too transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients it was practiced among canaaniteds syrian people of asia minor as well as greeks according to s r driver only a few moralist and jewish writers are on record as condemning it for example seneca moral epistles condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress be beardless and behave as a woman philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women the special laws iii see also his on the virtues where he justifies prohibition of cross dressing even the ot forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes deut petersen is also wrong in attributing to christianity the creating of the new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior these did not begin with paul rom but go as far back as ancient greece and even non christian contemporaries used them plato the test naph philo josephu plutarch and others used these words or related concepts linguistic grounds footnotes w l petersen can arsenokoitai be translated by homosexuals i cor i tim vc k j dover greek homosexuality cambridge harvard univ n we are conscious of the fact that plato s writings may not reflect athenian society or that the speakers in symposium may not reflect plato s view however it is assumed that they do and with this agrees dover homosexuality and other evidence cited below the translation is that of w r m lamb plato symposioum lcl cambridge harvard univ note the reference to adulteress if there is a homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes logically there must also be an adulterous conditon derived from birth elsewhere in the symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love the male and young men c but this must not be love for boys too young the latter should be outlawed d e such love of youths is to be permanent d lifelong and abiding a where homosexual love is considered a disgrace such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the cowardice of the ruled d an early charge of homophobia in athens it was more honorable to love openly than in secret d an ancient expression of coming out of the closet mutality was present this compels lover and beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue b for petersen to label the symposium a possible exception to his position is inadequate and misrepresentative it is a significant witness to greek society hundreds of years before the time of christ dover homosexuality finds homosexual desire and orientation in plato s works symposioum and phaedrus and elsewhere philo writes of those who habituate themselves to the practive of homosexual acts the special laws cf de vita contemplativa josephus says that homosexuality had become a fixed habit for some against apion clement of alexandria on matt

obviously bogus kinsey studies granted pomeroy bell weinberg national institute of mental health paper patterns of adjusment in deviant populations cited as part of the national institute of mental

bell weinberg this weekend can you tell also the janus report on sexual behavior samuel s janus ph d and cynthia l janus m d john wiley sons pub has the following table have you ever had a homosexual experience men women n yes no table how often have you had homosexual contact men women n a once b occasionally c frequently d ongoing active c d of is this number is consistent with kinsey pomery gebard bell weinberg and rice in the finding that of the male population is actively homosexual with an further breakdown bell wienberg of exclusively so and self identifying themselves as bisexuals pp as for debunking kinsey the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read was kinsey a fake and a pervert by philip nobile far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a secret sex criminal a hoosier dr mengele who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids but what really riles these critics is kinsey s towerin cultural influence his bestselling surveys sexual behavior in the human male and sexual behavior in the human female tore the sheets off the country s erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals his charts and graphs based on detailed histories of men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and or abnormal masturbation extramarital relations homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as american as strawberry shortcake yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination judith reisman the prosecution s expert witness at the mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati is the leader of the anti kinsey revisionists as well as his inspector javert in during a radio interview with pat buchanan in washington reisman accused kinsey of having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests now seven years later reisman has revived her charges in a different book titled kinsey sex and fraud just released by the small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette louisiana her coauthor is ed eichel a manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes in the book eichel contends that kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance the denormalization of heterosexuality if the authors are right then the world famous kinsey reports are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century and if they are wrong kinsey sex and fraud is a shameful smear despite the less than stellar credentials of kinsey s detractors legends are not what they used to be martin luther king may have committed plagiarism bruno bettelheim slapped young mental patients around father bruce ritter the founder of covenant house preyed on runaway boys closer to kinsey masters and johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey who filmed strange people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the closet the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job as a thinker the woman is no madame curie the year old former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional standing no current university position and no peer review publications though her creative resume was padded with phantom accomplishments for instance it listed a book as her own take back the night women on pornography that was actually written and edited by others then there is her ph d in speech communication from cleveland s case western reserve university although reisman has no bachelor s degree case granted her a master s in and a doctorate in her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian tv commentator but on the resume reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker to wit the application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media effects when reisman burst into prominence on buchanan s program it was love at first sight for al regnery the outwardly anti porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meese s justice department regnery was a young law and order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the united states after reisman s sensational radio session the sexual equivalent of joe mccarthy s wheeling speech regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests first he tried to shovel her for a quasi frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal but in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b a probe of child images in the cartoons playboy penthouse and hust ler incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general s pornography commission when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department that spring regnery resigned from his post only days before the new republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house notwithstanding the six figure humiliation reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right as the darling of the sex cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men s magazines and blames aids on gays kinsey sex and fraud is reisman s latest grasp for respectability pat buchanan of course is putting his krugerrands on reisman s ultimate vindication this book is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front cover he especially liked the antigay parts smacking his lips in his syndicated column he declared it may just blow the sewer cap off kinsey s monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in aberration expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr kinsey s research the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j accuse is that kinsey was a sex mad pedophile who molested little boys in nazi type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume a similar charge was first recited at the fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in to no effect before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in kinsey sex and fraud mengele like scientific experiments on infants and children were the basis for kinsey s conclusions on childhood sexuality somewhere and sometime in the course of the project kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost years this of course would implicate kinsey and his team in promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal activity in the opinion of this book s authors that is exactly how part of kinsey s child sexuality research took place donning his psychohistorian s cap and citing an fbi manual on child molesters as a guide eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as reisman said kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys such as y m c a camp counselor boys club leader and boy scout leader activities he kept up during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his marriage as crude as his analysis seems eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview if you ve ever been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive he averred everything in his life is directed at getting children i didn t mention this in our book but the caption under kinsey s high school picture was a quote from hamlet man delights me not no sic nor woman neither what do you think they were picking up on before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of kinsey s sex crimes something must be said about kinsey s scientific modus operandi he was a fiendish collector as a young zoologist with a d sc from harvard he collected million gall wasps and million related insects when he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in he was no less curious or acquisitive nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him he compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros fascinated him it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins and so with the fervor of his bughunting days kinsey collected information about kids though even his worst enemies until reisman and eichel refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure gold there was nothing like it in the literature kinsey s main source a year old govemment worker was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met this man whose history took hours to log had sex with over boys and girls as well as of family members including his father and grandmother a sexual hobbyist and passionate record keeper he gave kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys relying on the man s meticulous research which involved following some boys for as long as years kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well as the speed and the capacity of climax what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality kinsey had reported as fact children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy he concluded without raising eyebrows in then along came judith reisman ignorng the legitimacy of kinsey s inquiry she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington she was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal well was he or wasn t he let s go to the text there is no evidence in kinsey sex and fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a trace of hearsay that implicates kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments after years on the trail reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge amazingly enough kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy kinsey s coauthor on both reports to whom reisman has never spoken it turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in pomeroy s biography titled dr kinsey and the institute for sex research after frisking every the and and in both books reisman came up with what she believes are smoking sentences to establish kinsey s alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey directed the orgasm studies on kids she cites his tell tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writers test their theories by empirical study and statistical procedures then she combines this quote with kinsey s statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved putting two and two together kinsey s empiricism and lengthy experimentation she arrives at her hint but realizing this dog would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to kinsey s supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement as for the alleged participation after poring over pomeroy s biography reisman found several hidden clues suggesting kinsey s likely hands on approach to kiddie sex here the chain of reasoning is more complex she points out that kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal sex reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinsey s child sex experiments catch the may reisman was also struck by kinsey s doubting thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits kinsey according to pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things for himself pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit because he had not personally witnessed this event kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist how then did kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a month old infant from the mere history of a sex offender but of course he did not he depended on their records from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climax in cottontail has reisman defamed the legendary kinsey paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington reached by telephone gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied reisman s nasty imputations i don t understand the resistance of people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children gebhard said more in exasperation than anger that is where sex begins we were happy to take data wherever we found it even though pedophiles commit criminal acts they are usually not violent folks they wouldn t be very successful if they were one of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students as for directing experiments that s absurd we never told any of our subjects what to do lt was against our principles almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves that would have been highly inappropriate i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watched it as for kinsey s sex life it is still shrouded in confidentiality he was married to the same woman for years and fathered four children apparently there are no huge sexual revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years gebhard took his boss s history back in the s but he refuses to discuss what he knows we never divulge anything about anybody s history whether dead or alive he says reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that i had once worked for penthouse not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years in keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing the kinsey practice of euphemizing incest my offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near relative in a article on the subject of incest as a synonym for intercourse lying with appears eight times in genesis ed eichel is a different story though seemingly obsessed by kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long conversations he told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in new york university s human sexuality program in the early s it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals he says around eichel came upon reisman s critique of kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections eventually eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman and from this union kinsey sex and fraud was born eichel s main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step the ultimate goal of cross generational sex sex with children when i pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions he said weakly you don t think kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the kinsey reports meanwhile eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data perfect that s just what the country needs a house un american sexual activities committee looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader a sympathizer or god forbid a subject of dr alfred kinsey elf elf halcyon com elf sternberg the

       " ' reflections on bosnia owen neier reflections on bosnia lord owen and the serbs in early february lord owen made appearances in new york city on the donahue and charlie rose shows on a couple of occasions on those shows lord owen gave away his pro serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by serbs before wwii it was as if he were saying that since the serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the hitler years they should be allowed to reconquer them today i was familiar with this view because my father a yugoslav jew who escaped to this country during the war was aided and found sympathy among the serbs during those harrowing years in recent months when the subject of serbian aggression was mentioned my father would make the point that serbs were killed by nazi and pro nazi croatian forces known as the ustasha my father is so pro serbian that he dismissed reports of serbian atrocities my father also excoriated new york times columnist anthony lewis because my father said anthony lewis is always talking about the muslims update april after an uneasy truce in and around sbernica shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the clinton administration dithers its response in the days leading to the collapse of resistance at sbernica lord owen changed his tune previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger u n relief workers when serbian forces began to march on sbernica the threat to u n relief soldiers went unmentioned while lord owen called for outside intervention to stop serbian aggression including the use of air strikes the current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the west and a failure of the vance owen initiative which did nothing to halt the serbs now that it s too late to save muslim areas that lord owen felt should be in a muslim state lord owen belatedly calls for strong action clinton and bosnia in the summer of george kenney a senior state department official the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk made news when he resigned from the state department because of the bush administration s refusal to take any action to halt serbian aggression as kenney saw it bush s inaction was largely due to the president s unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there apparently the same is true of the clinton administration clinton gives the impression that he cares more than bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy but the practical effect has so far been the same according to the new york times the clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid march report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect safe havens for the muslims at one point senate majority leader george mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from congress that he called for an investigation instead of helping the desperate bosnians clinton has signalled again and again that milosevic and the serbs are free to do what they want in bosnia indeed clinton and the west have been signalling that the serbs should get on with the job and finish off the bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way a key signal was when clinton made it clear that he would not send in american military forces on the ground on this issue clinton has made me wistful for bush bush and baker could not have done worse and might have been pressured to do better well before this time lives in bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed the nation the left and the bosnian quandary typical of the left s inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in bosnia i e a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives is the editorial on the bosnian quandary in the nation in the end the editorial votes to do nothing even while noticing the ghastly atrocities of the bosnian serbs and that the greater and lesser powers dither and fuss and hang back before anything else happens the clinton administration ought to pay the million the united states owes the u n the editorial concludes in its most striking passage the editorial writer warns that those who are pushing president clinton to intervene on the side of the bosnians had better review u s foreign policy since world war ii the editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the bosnian serbs are no worse than any number of u s clients including the chileans the south africans the greek fascists and others in a subsequent column for the nation christopher hitchens correctly called this editorial contemptible william pfaff a european based journalist who writes for the the new yorker and the los angeles times is among a group of liberal columnists like anthony lewis and leslie gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong western and american intervention to stop the serbs pfaff s most recent column liberal opinion week is entitled international cowardice worsened bosnian tragedy he clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent croatia in june or to block or penalize the military aggression by serbia that immediately followed and the atrocious ethnic cleansing which followed that the united nations now contemplates deploying in bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors yugoslavia has since experienced he goes on to explain that u n plans now envisaged call for a more daunting and open ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago aryeh neier on the serbs in his watching rights column in the the nation aryeh neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the aggressors the preferred term for the serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling sarajevo for more than a year he explains that there is no military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people above all few of those aligned with the forces attacking sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt they are not city people it is this i believe aside from a desire to break the morale of bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price that explains the conduct of the siege of sarajevo i t is a loathing for all that is urban pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made sarajevo the object for devastation historically most of the serbian population in bosnia and herzegovina has been rural while muslims who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of ottoman rule made up a disproportionate share of the urban population the destruction of sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city it is also an attack on the urban idea the demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan the light that neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake the serbs represent the know nothing anti secularist fundamentalist fascist forces who are attacking the urban cosmopolitan secular multi cultural idea they are attacking the rest of us just as hitler did one irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over bosnia it was for awhile maintained by the serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the bosnian muslims to create a fundamentalist state neier has shown that it is the serbs who are the great threat to secularism multi culturalism diversity and democracy it s the serbs who are attacking the democratic notion the democratic idea anthony lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for clinton s presidency depend on his acting effectively against serbian aggression first of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess times but it s not merely a betrayal of our values it s because the serbs are attacking us by proxy just as hitler was one argument for decisive action by the west that is heard in a different form is that war in the balkans is destablizing for europe we hear it as the bosnians are europe s palestinians that is to say just as the palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the middle east just so will the hundreds of thousands of yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in europe for decades to come one of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the atlantic ocean divides us the americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of europe if europe is destabilized the u s will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems as in a whirlpool sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom and as past history and pfaff have shown it s much better if we do so decisively quickly and on our terms sincerely ronald bleier',\n",

factor in the turkish evacuation of persia and motivated the ittihadist young turk leaders to annihilate the turkish armenians the question of responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all ottoman armenians has evolved into a polemic hundreds of books articles and documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence and death many writers such as the british bryce and toynbee french pinon german lepsius american morganthau and gibbons have insisted that the massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed the have refuted the ottoman government s official publications and justifications by substantiating that anti armenian measures were deliberated by the ittihadists even before the outbreak of war the fact remains than an estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million armenians perished within a few months and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following years to the ravages of disease famine and refugee life unknown

and has been exposed as a plagiarizer for example experts from an interview in greek with professor spyros vryonis from nyc s national herald thanks mr g b few people know of the problem i faced at ucla when professor stanford shaw was due for promotion i knew him to be turkey s man due to my reading knowledge of turkish and my seniority over him i was a member of the promotion committee for that case i sat down and read his entire treatise history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey it took me three months and i found out from volume i that he had plagiarized uzun jarsoglu an eminent turkish specialist on ottoman history shaw himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome of a year search through the ottoman archives well i went on leave and managed to show of volume i containing around sentences to be the result of plagiarism matching each sentence with passages from the original work he had even reproduced the errors so i produced a pages manuscript and submitted a pages report on shaw s plagiarism the university however rejected my report and after a closed meeting promoted stanford shaw to distinguished professor i paid a price for all this upset by the whole process i confronted the entire university structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman i asked for permission to run a seminar on shaw s book that was denied by the president of the university while the center for near eastern studies granted me permission the president was depriving me of my academic freedom luckily the dean refused to give in and i did run the

       " ' rfd soc religion taize this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the johannine hours as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of taize pronounced te zay in france name of proposed newsgroup soc religion taize unmoderated purpose of the group the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in france many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly johannine hour which will be posted at the beginning of each month a johannine hour involves a short commentary on a given bible passage followed by some questions for reflection any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here we are not interested in theological debate and even less in polemics no expertise is required the idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own life journey the idea of johannine hours was born in taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible s message in the midst of their daily life because of work or studies it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods there in silence we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of christ during the time of silence it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if in some biblical expressions we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ the idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of christ not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply perhaps those who read and think about the johannine hours in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects the personal aspect of silent personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network background of the taize community the following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the taize pronounced te zay community a parable of communion august with europe in the grip of world war ii brother roger aged set up home in the almost abandoned village of taize in eastern france his dream to bring together a monastic community which would live out a parable of community a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time centering his life on prayer he used his house to conceal refugees especially jews fleeing from the nazi occupation an international and ecumenical community taize s founder spent the first two years alone others joined him later and at easter seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy year by year still others have entered the community each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation today there are brothers catholics and from various protestant backgrounds from over twenty different countries some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in asia africa north and south america the brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves not even family inheritances and the community holds no capital the brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work in sisters of saint andrew an international catholic community founded years ago came to live in the neighbouring village to share the responsibility of welcoming people in taize taize and the young the intercontinental meetings young adults and less young have been coming to taize in ever greater numbers since hundreds of thousands of people from europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search intercontinental meetings take place each week sunday to sunday throughout the year and they include youth from between and countries during any one week the meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity the meetings in summer can have up to participants a week three times every day the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the church of reconciliation built in when the village church became too small a pilgrimage of trust on earth the community has never wanted to create a movement around itself instead people are called to commit themselves in their church at home in their neighbourhood their city or village to support them in this taize has created what it calls a pilgrimage of trust on earth at the end of each year the pilgrimage has a european meeting which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of europe for several days in a major city there have also been meetings in asia and in the united states every year brother roger writes an open letter to the young usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year note discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in news groups for any further information contact brother roy almac co uk brother roy almac co uk st

of different features and abilities the choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features at this point most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate for a speedy window manager a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move also if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows joe english joe trystero art com i ve found that a good font for tiling is x aka misc fixed medium r normal c iso it is the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun x screen and still get two column terminal windows side by side on the display with no overlap other font suggestions will be accepted the x server which server make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware if you have a monochrome monitor use a monochrome x server on my monochrome sun i haven t noticed much difference between the xsun colour server and xsunmono however it was pointed out to me that xsunmono is about k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging thanks to jonny farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk michael salmon michael salmon eos ericsson se how your server was compiled can also make a difference jeff law law schirf cs utah edu advises us that on a sun system x should be compiled with gcc version or with the unbundled sun compiler you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not using the bundled sunos compiler i assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high quality commercial compilers on the market locking the server into ram has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and does not get paged eg via a call to plock does this help performance at all i ve had one inquiry on this topic and a few pointers to the plock function call but no hard evidence from someone who s tried it i am not in a position to give it a try thanks to eric c claeys ecc eperm att com danny backx db sunbim be juan d martin juando cnm us es starting your server joe english joe trystero art com if you start up a lot of clients in your xsession or whatever sleep for a second or two after launching each one after i changed my xclients script to do this logging in actually took less time we have a heavily loaded system without much core though this sounds crazy but i have confirmed that it works warner losh imp solbourne com provided me with a good explanation of why this works which i have summarized here when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections a lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts this process touches a large number of pages any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the cpu and more importantly memory if you put a sleep in there you give the server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up similarly there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources being fetched programs initializing state and databases and so forth all this activity is typically memory intensive once this initialization is done the process has reached a steady state the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your xinitrc you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation s limited resources this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation as there are so many variables to be considered available ram local swap space load average number of users on your system which clients you are starting etc currently in my xinitrc i have a situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve experimented with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i ve even tried sleep exec start x clients script and then in start x clients script i had sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my xinitrc and had settled down into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched all of these yielded fairly comparable results and so i just stuck with my current setup for its simplicity you will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you fonts loading fonts takes time and ram if you minimize the number of fonts your applications use you ll get speed increases in load up time one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits you and configure all your clients or at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server this will also conserve server resources since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server farrell mckay fbm ptcburp ptcbu oz au joe english joe trystero art com eg my main xterm font is x so i also have twm set up to use x in all it s menus and icons etc twm s default font is x since i don t normally use x i ve eliminated one font from my server oliver jones oj roadrunner pictel com keep fonts local to the workstation rather than loading them over nfs if you will make extensive use of r scalable fonts use a font server about the resources file keep your xresources xdefaults file small saves ram and saves on server startup time joe english joe trystero art com one suggestion in your xdefaults xresources file try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications for example reversevideo true then separate your resources into individual client specific resource files for example home lib app defaults in your login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults n the comp windows x frequently asked questions faq contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work ed so when xterm launches it loads its resources from app defaults xterm xdvi finds them in app defaults xdvi and so on and so forth note that not all clients follow the same xxxxx resource file naming pattern you can check in your system app defaults directory often usr x r lib x app defaults to find the proper name and then name your personal resource files with the same name this is all documented in the xt specification pg thanks to kevin samborn samborn mtkgc com michael urban urban cobra jpl nasa gov and mike long mikel ee cornell edu kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers this method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits easier to maintain more usable fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager property as a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker since it doesn t have to load all your resources applications only process their own resources never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them it also has drawbacks the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up this doesn t seem to make that much of a performance difference and you might consider this a huge boon to usability if you are modifying an application s resource database you just need to re run the application without having to xrdb again xrdb will by default run your xdefaults file through cpp when your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs they will not watch out for this i had c style comments in my xdefaults file which cpp stripped out when i switched to this method of distributed resource files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources xt did not provide any error message when it encountered the c style comments in the resource files it simply silently aborted processing the resource file the loss of preprocessing which can be very handy e g ifdef color is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management you may also run into some clients which break the rules for example neither emacs nor xvt will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in xdefaults when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored your client will not find its resources loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources casey leedom casey gauss llnl gov a possible compromise suggestion that i have and am planning on trying is to put resources for all my heavily used clients eg xterm into my xdefaults file and to use the separate resources files method for clients that i seldom use define your display properly client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server in that situation rather than setting your display environment variable to hostname where hostname is the name of your workstation you should set your display variable to unix or by doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests thanks to patrick j horgan pjh ras amdahl com see the display names section of the x man page for further

don t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non mit patches and so have elected not to include it here hopefully mit will apply this minor lines patch themselves in the meantime if you want to try it yourself email jody ed clients if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running think also about the kind of programs you are running for example is there a smaller clock program than xclock unfortunately i haven t really noticed that programs advertise how large they are so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients eg xclock xterm xbiff are welcome ed i ve received some contradictory advice from people on the subject of x client programs some advocate the use of programs that are strictly xlib based since xt xaw and other toolkits are rather large others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries in this case using a non xt for example client program may actually increase the amount of ram consumed the upshot of all this seems to be don t mix toolkits that is try and use just athena clients or just xview clients or just motif clients etc if you use more than one then you re dragging in more than one toolkit library know your environment and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment thanks to rob sartin opensi sartin uunet uu net duncan sinclair sinclair dcs gla ac uk sinclair

better terminal emulator for x from the readme file distributed with xterm abandon all hope ye who enter here this is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution ugly maybe but at my site it s still the most used i suspect that xterm is one of the most used clients at many if not most sites laziness isn t there a better terminal emulator available see below if you must use xterm you can try reducing the number of savelines to reduce memory usage oliver jones oj roadrunner pictel com jonny farringdon j farringdon psychol ucl ac uk xvt suggested by richard hesketh rlh ukc ac uk available export lcs mit edu in contrib xvt tar z if you don t need all the esoteric features of xterm then get hold of xvt it was written here just to save swap space as xterm is rather a hog this was written as a partial clone of xterm you don t have to rename your resources as xvt pretends to be xterm in it s current version you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm i ve heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature but i ve not found any yet update march i recently had a few email conversations with brian warkentin brian warkentine eng sun com regarding xvt he questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm for instance xvt may initialize slightly faster but compare scrolling speed try this quickie benchmark bin time dd if etc termcap bs and see which program can scroll faster also while xterm may be slightly larger in ram requirements we don t have any hard numbers here does anyone else shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm s paging requirements are not that major as an experiment he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm but it made little difference since if you never use it it never gets brought into memory so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm in summary caveat emptor your mileage may vary if you can provide some hard data i d like to see it specifically how much ram each occupies how much swap each needs relative speed of each mterm suggested by der mouse mouse lightning mcrcim mcgill edu available larry mcrcim mcgill edu in x mterm src mterm ball o wax i also have my own terminal emulator its major lack is scrollback but some people like it anyway tuning your client suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster from scott barman scott asd com comes a suggestion regarding motif text field widgets i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets i was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes particularly the initial one in the field examining the what was going on with xscope i found it it seems that when the resource xmnblinkrate is non zero and the focus is on a text field widget or even just a text widget the i beam cursor will blink every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets the widget code is making a request to the server copyarea the user can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to it is not noticeable on a mhz sparc but it does make a little difference on a slower system this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas consider your heavily used clients are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server requests miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures don t use large bitmaps gif s etc as root window backgrounds the more complicated your root window bitmap the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows or redraw etc these take up ram and cpu power i work on a sun sparc and i m conscious of performance issues i can t comprehend it when i see people with a mb sun running xphoon as their root window i ll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation if you re anything like me you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients and so rarely see the root window anyway thanks to qiang alex zhao azhao cs arizona edu for reminding me of this one ed a quicker mouse using xset you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen when you move your mouse i use xset m in my xinitrc file which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist see the xset man page for further ideas and information hint sometimes you may want to slow down your

are tons of things you can do some that stick out for motif programs don t set xmfontlist resources for individual buttons labels lists et al use the defaultfontlist or labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager widget again stick to as few fonts as possible better yet don t use motif at all it s an absolute pig don t create and destroy widgets on the fly try to reuse them this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits too use a line width of in gcs on some servers this makes a huge difference compress and collapse multiple expose events this can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one francois staes frans kiwi uia ac be just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of xt based applications since they use malloc heavily they suggested trying out the gnuy malloc but i didn t find the time yet i did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free and the differences were indeed very noticeable somewhat times faster any confirmation on this from anyone ed andre beck andre beck irs inf tu dresden de unnecessary noexpose events most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines but they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the blits this will cause a noexpose event every blit that in most cases only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it s event loop again and again thousands of xchangegc requests this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded x apps where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed again and again xt uses a definitely better mechanism by caching and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters this will remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the connection by moving it toward the client startup phase say what some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first david b lewis by day dbl osf org by night david craft uunet uu net how about this swap displays with someone else run all your programs on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your machine onto the

same cpu as your server when you run it on the same machine not really a major problem except that the x client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing timothy h panton thp westhawk uucp firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu s are mostly idle x s cpu usage is bursty so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu intensive at the same time is small if they are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your action the second factor is that context switches are expensive using cpu s halves them you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network typically k vs k for a pipe allowing even fewer context switches other sources of information volume in o

village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields

population closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire leaving erivan on april armenian volunteers reached van on may and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during the next two days knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman s enemy increased drastically ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations who in turn massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading russian armies meanwhile czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans with the president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious russian army with their blood to serve the victory of russian arms let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the bosporus let with your will great majesty the peoples remaining under the turkish yoke receive freedom let the armenian people of turkey who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of russia armenians again flooded into the

report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents lord curzon aharonin interview is the report of the british high commissioner to caucasia sir oliver wardrop an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at least percent of the population of that republic

light on september the national council on us arab relations invited the kuwaiti ambassador to the united states saud nasser al sabah the following are quotes of his speech kuwait itself was an entity identified as kuwait even before iraq was identified as iraq in the ottoman empire kuwait was in existence since we continued to be in existence until the conflict between the ottoman empire and the british and others in the area thereafter we signed with the british in a protective agreement whereby the british guaranteed the sovereignty and security of kuwait in the british and the ottoman signed an agreement defining without any doubt the borders of kuwait as they stand today such an agreement was reconfirmed in between the kuwaiti government and the iraqi government at that time that is when iraq became a state after kuwait itself in when we declared our independence iraq seized the opportunity to claim kuwait as part of iraq there were threats the british came in and arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of kuwait in kuwait and iraq again signed border agreement thereby defining our territory and iraq s recognition to the sovereignty and territory of kuwait compiled by firyal alshalalbi origins of kuwait the establishment of kuwait is attributed to barrak b ghurair of the bani khalid who used kuwait as a summer residence the beginning of kuwait goes back to the late th century and some historians go further up to kuwait s name is derived from al kut which means fortress kuwait is also called qurain which is the diminutive of qarn a horn or hill kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment the utub al sabah family is a branch of utub settled in kuwait during the early th century they lived under the protection of bani khalid until after that they became independent and sabah bin jabir was chosen as the first ruler for utub carsten niebuhr a dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the arabia he was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in by the king of denmark to arabia he documented details of arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the gulf and in the case of kuwait he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known kuwait and qurain niebuhr s chart of the persian gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century see the map from abu hakima history of eastern arabia pub al sabah utub kept good relations with other powers in the eastern arabia according to ahmed abu hakima s conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern arabia between there was no ottoman rule on the region in the second half of the th century there was no ottoman ruler in eastern arabia in fact ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged their attempts to restore their lost position in al hasa through the campaign of thuwayni in and ali pasha s expedition against the wahhabis in were unsuccessful at kuwait the nearest point of the utbi domains to the ottoman mutasallimiyya of basra the shaikh was under no form of ottoman control the aim of utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the gulf p abu hakima continued in his conclusions that kuwait was not a dependency of basra the persian occupation of basra did not affect kuwait p kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab world this identity was clear to the british and the french who tried to win the support of kuwait s sheikh between when the british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the gulf area independent kuwait this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the ottomans in against the wahhabis in eastern arabia where the oil fields in saudi arabia now kuwait and its ruler at that time sheikh abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir allied themselves with the turks abdullah role in the fighting was not a minor one he joined the expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of al qatif had it not been for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet al qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours in relation to this a question arises as to why the ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment the answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition because the ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area the sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against su ud or any sheikh in the war zone kuwait which was not a party to the above mentioned treaty of was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it from the above text we can see that kuwait was not part of the ottomans or the british colonies for more details about the mentioned expedition please check out the source of the above text the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait this is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the following text discusses a dispute on an estate called sufiyya in zubair iraq between the sheikh of kuwait and al zuhair tribe in zubair in trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the estate which was purchased by his father sheikh jabir in this property was sequestered by a turkish qa immaqam representative on the basis of a claim by the al zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n e sufiyya at the same time sheikh sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of fao some cultivators who had immigrated from persian territory it should be recalled that the turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimants abdulla ibn sabah the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who went to basra as his father s agent in the case narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive eventually the dispute was settled by the wali governor of baghdad in favor of the sheikh of kuwait the decision of the governor of basra in favor of the sheikh was apparently made for various reasons some writers think that the governor wanted to win abdulla over to the turkish side and suggest that the governor namiq pasha even offered him the title of qa immaqam which he declined nevertheless the proceedings of the turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with zubair it seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the british agent at basra the people of kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule lorimer suggests that the final order of namiq pasha upholding the kuwait sheikh s title to sufiyya was perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah with the object of attacking zubair if the decision should go against him had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the wahhabi amir in addition to this legal matter with zubair kuwait had had other problems with basra whose courts tried to jail abdulla ibn sabah as explained above however kuwait s relations with the ottoman mutasallims of basra had at times been amicable and in several instances those mutasallims even sought refuge at kuwait when pressured by the pashas of baghdad who exercised control over them source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans when pelly colonel pelly the british resident in the gulf visited kuwait for the first time on march he was met at jahra by sheikh mubarak the second son of the ruler sheikh sabah just before he reached kuwait town on march he was met by sheikh abdulla the eldest son and heir apparent who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to a very good home which had been prepared for pelly and his companions scarcely had we entered it says pelly when sheikh sabah himself came this description of pelly s reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol the government system of kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by pelly the government is patriarchal says pelly the sheikh managing the political and the cazee qadi the judicial departments the sheikh himself would submit to the cazee s decision punishment was rarely inflicted indeed there seems little government interference anywhere and little need of an army pelly in admiration of how the sheikh ran the affairs of the country retold the following remark which the sheikh had made to him when my father was nearly years old he called me and said i shall soon die i have made no fortune and can leave you no money but i have made many and true friends grapple them while other states around the gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill government mine has gone on flourishing hold to my policy and though you are surrounded by desert and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes you will prosper source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada independent kuwait this is another article that testifies to the independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the ottomans the british had always regarded sheikh jabir as a good friend but in october an event took place at kuwait which could have weakened those good relations on october lieutenant edmunds the assistant resident at abu shahr in iran arrived in kuwait on a special mission from the resident captain hennell his mission was to find out if kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the mediterranean the british war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of kuwait bay the salute was not acknowledged and edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the sheikh after edmunds return to abu shahr both he and captain hennell explained this unusual behavior of the sheikh to have been due not to ill will but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent at kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the british therefore they considered that jabir s conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the british if the british tolerated the attitude of jabir towards edmunds so also did the egyptians earlier in the same year some of the most wanted men in the wahhabi camp such as umar ibn ufaisan the wahhabi general in al hasa and wahhabi tribes like al duwaish sought refuge in kuwait protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by sheikh abdulla ibn sabah this can therefore be looked upon as an indication of self confidence an outcome of kuwait s independence from foreign powers it corroborates the fact that kuwait if necessary was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors this defense depended not only on the walls of the city but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other arab fleets of the time as to kuwait s position between and one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling wahhabis and egyptians relations with the british and even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good terms source the modern history of kuwait by ahmed abu hakima mcgill university canada they were trying to recover land they believed was theirs much like the argentines in the faulklands the kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he d settle the dispute the old fashioned way are you really this cartoonish or do you seriously believe this if so please post your proof everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited iraq together and

writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents saying hopefully the effect of policy x will be y is much different from saying hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y here you ve made both statements if the former describes a reasonably likely outcome of policy x then perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence formerly the national coalition to ban handguns interesting name change don t you think who include murder and suicide by firearms in the leading causes of unintentional death figures but don t include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death can t you see past the bullshit i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things but the anti gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a stastically serious problem and even if you don t use these deaths as a justification for gun control these groups do i m sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures i think the conclusion was a reasonable one the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be they are not a serious problem statistically speaking please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful sorry if it wasn t clear to me i thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat of passion shootings i have to disagree on all these counts i can t understand how a buying guns from people who aren t intending to misuse them obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren t going to turn them in could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all methods per year who do you think i should believe the people who call everyone up to age children when they re screaming about the carnage of our nation s children being caused by handguns or the centers for disease control ah yes the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people document is to enact laws in states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children the agency that funded the study of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban had saved x lives yes they actually gave us a number on the basis of a look at the number of shootings rather than the rate of shootings it wasn t their fault that the population of dc dropped in their post law period if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in okay i ll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these i ll retract my dispute of your numbers however i would be greatly interested in seeing how cphv and cdc came up with these numbers the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home what s this got to do with anything hell when i was in elementary school i came home to an empty house with guns in it why is this a problem i didn t touch the guns i had been taught not to i had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage the fuse box the car the knives the oven and the tools the problem is not the guns it s the parents california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns nothing no criminal prosecution no expulsion in most cases not even suspension they take the gun slap the kids on the wrist say ain t it awful and go on as if everything s back to normal what s wrong with this picture okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die i don t think koresh was the messiah either but isn t it obvious that if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him then he believed the children were much safer inside the compound i didn t say he was sane just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what he thought was going on he thought he had them in the one place where harm wouldn t come to them if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive let s see you try to find the exits unbarricade them and flee a fire

i teach adult sunday school in has been a follower of copeland for years he has thousands of tapes by the faith teachers in the class recently i quoted several of the teachers heretical statements to his surprise since then i ve been able to talk to him at length about these issues the leader of the women s group at my church is a benny hinn fan recently i found that she has been lending good morning holy spirit to women in the church that prompted my quotes in sunday school as well as my lending cic to people in the church i m well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies what heresies a jesus became sin took on the very nature of the devil and became one with him b jesus death on the cross wasn t enough to atone c jesus was dragged to hell after his death was beat and abused by satan and demons thus finishing our atonement satan was ruling over him there d jesus was born again in hell e jesus died spiritually lost his divinity and reassumed it after the resurrection f we are gods these are heresies documentation will be provided re these teachings upon request zane or what does it do for you is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word faith movement which you d been contemplating joining for so long but now that you ve read the book you ve been saved from all of that my reply it wasn t christianity in crisis that helped me it was a booklet by swaggart that i mentioned above but cic is much much better tremendous documentation and insights zane i don t have a nice scriptural answer for why i believe it is at best un profitable for christians to engage in this type of activity heresy hunting my reply why do you call it heresy hunting hunting implies it isn t readily accessible or available this movement is the fastest growing movement in christendom hagin has sold over million books and booklets hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than swindoll and dobson combined fred price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the usa doesn t sound like much hunting is needed it is scriptural to expose doctrinal error i gave some verses to you before more can be given most of the epistles were written due to error doctrinal practical in the churches the early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy it s not a new thing remember luther zane i would like to point out though that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics but this is my un documented opinion my reply if you can provide documentation it would be appreciated read ephesians esp vss and and tell me what causes disunity and immaturity in the body eph till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting disunity contrary to popular opinion isn t caused by exposing error it s caused by error zane there are many who probably give no place for seeing the scriptures as documenting a spiritual development or growth in its writers but i would suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of love in the end my reply most scholars believe paul wrote timothy last let s examine his admonitions to tim to ascertain how mellow he had become ti hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me in faith and love which are in christ jesus that good thing which was committed to you keep by the holy spirit who dwells in us this you know that all those in asia have turned away from me among whom are phygellus and hermogenes ti be diligent to present yourself approved to god a worker who does not need to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some ti and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will ti for of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins led away by various lusts always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as jannes and jambres resisted moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds disapproved concerning the faith but they will progress no further for their folly will be manifest to all as theirs also was ti yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of knowing from whom you have learned them and that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work ti preach the word be ready in season and out of season convince rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teaching for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but according to their own desires because they have itching ears they will heap up for themselves teachers and they will turn their ears away from the truth and be turned aside to fables but you be watchful in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry ti alexander the coppersmith did me much harm may the lord repay him according to his works you also must beware of him for he has greatly resisted our words zane the picture i have of paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves but of one who teaches the sheep with many tears the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves my reply act therefore i testify to you this day that i am innocent of the blood of all men for i have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of god therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock also from among yourselves men will rise up speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves therefore watch and remember that for three years i did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears zane for all the warning paul does it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf but i will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him everyone in asia wasn t it my reply paul mentioned names ti this charge i commit to you son timothy according to the prophecies previously made concerning you that by them you may wage the good warfare having faith and a good conscience which some having rejected concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck of whom are hymenaeus and alexander whom i delivered to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme ti this you know that all those in asia have turned away from me among whom are phygellus and hermogenes ti but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some ti for demas has forsaken me having loved this present world and has departed for thessalonica crescens for galatia titus for dalmatia ti alexander the coppersmith did me much harm may the lord repay him according to his works you also must beware of him for he has greatly resisted our words so did john jo i wrote to the church but diotrephes who loves to have the preeminence among them does not receive us therefore if i come i will call to mind his deeds which he does prating against us with malicious words and not content with that he himself does not receive the brethren and forbids those who wish to putting them out of the church jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines rev but i have a few things against you because you have there those who hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate repent or else i will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth rev nevertheless i have a few things against you because you allow that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols and i gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she did not repent indeed i will cast her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he who searches the minds and hearts and i will give to each one of you according to your works zane i question too the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults deliberate or otherwise of others maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey or barely cakes with no worldly goods at stake money to be made or no reputations to maintain i would question their motives conscious or otherwise less my reply i won t comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others but even if they had bad motives remember what paul said phi some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and in this i rejoice yes and will rejoice zane if we want to be true to the admonitions of scripture many of which you list about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines i suggest we start by allowing the wolf program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the cross my reply please explain zane secondly i suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships which in the strict scriptural sense is the local city church my reply if heresy was not being propagated over the mass media then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure unfortunately heresy is being taught not just in copeland s church or hagin s or hinn s or price s but all over the radio in print etc no pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church it s imperative that leadership be made aware of this and cic does just that also let s examine a passage of scripture eph and he himself gave some to be apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers eph for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry for the edifying of the body of christ these ministry gifts that the lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church but for the body of christ paul was an apostle he traveled all over distilling his message he was also a teacher co for this reason i have sent timothy to you who is my beloved and faithful son in the lord who will remind you of my ways in christ as i teach everywhere in every church co but as god has distributed to each one as the lord has called each one so let him walk and so i ordain in all the churches also co and god has appointed these in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps administrations varieties of tongues eph till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ notice that the five fold ministries are going to be around till the church is in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man this i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus returns see cor but god wants the body to continue on maturing what hinders maturity and unity of the body eph that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting it s clear that false doctrine integrated into the church by the trickery of men causes disunity the thing we are striving for and spiritual immaturity the church continues in spiritual childhood when christians are tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine the five fold ministry of which there does not appear to be clear scriptural denominational boundaries pastors appear responsible for their individual flock is to deal with these doctrines when necessary in their struggle to equip the body all believers are called to do this to a degree jud beloved while i was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation i found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints for certain men have crept in unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation ungodly men who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ zane if you ll notice in scripture the heresy hunters that went from church to church and area to area were the bad guys and they went after the good guy namely paul who they considered to be the arch heretic my reply they were themselves heretics trying to discredit paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught zane let s face it the wolves are here for a reason and we are here for the reason and let s hope the wolves become sheep and the sheep lambs my reply yes ti and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will amen frank

       " ' full color image editor for sgi workstations i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image the following is the relevant sections from the man page pre release of may bit l name bit bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations description bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type bits or color index in any order and in any of the many built in styles of display you can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions e g postscript bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image features bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing is complete the processed image will be displayed current features include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x and or y directions with the option of subpixel sampling o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in tex e g alpha small beta produces greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta o presents graphically the histogram of an image o performs arbitrary to pixel transformation the transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished rather easily by to transformation in combination with the avai lability of graphical histograms of the image o places simple geometric figures sgfs e g arrows circles trian gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e g postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and y directions independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a circle o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and to transformation very accurate result can be obtained o performs histogram equalization o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of arbitrary order o crops a rectangular portion of an image o cuts and pastes across images o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images slideshow o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities or as an intensity vs distance plot o performs image type conversions o converts image formats o smoothes an image special convolution o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it o modify an individual pixel s rgb values o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release supported formats o iris rgb native to sgi iris o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm portable any map including ppm pgm and pbm o xbm x window bitmap o tiff o postscript write only hardware requirements any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including indigoes where to get it anonymous ftp to monte svec uh edu pub bit bitxxx tar z where xxx is the version number current version is read src readme for installation instructions after unpacking acknowledgement jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups s library version forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui both jpeg and forms library are included in this release bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images the built in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it and you will like it as always any comments bug reports are welcome',\n",

post from my text file gordon r had promised to send it back to me but he s pretty mad at me right now so i ll just retype it since digging through all my references is very time consuming took me all day for that pms post i m not going to cite any references gordon r has them i m going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan s new nutrition textbook which was not in my original material to point out that what i m going to say has some support in the medical community diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i ve already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection now i m going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u s as far as infection is concerned vitamin a when vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti infection vitamin many people linus pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i ve already covered big mistake in my opinion vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well it s role in both cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite vitamin a comes in two completely different forms retinol and beta carotene retinol is the animal form and it s toxic beta carotene is the plant form and it s completely nontoxic both retinol and beta carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have iu to iu of retinol stored we are born with iu in our liver u s autopsy has shown that about of americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as they were born with if you don t believe that nutritional reserves like that of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u s the u s rda for vitamin a in an adult male is re or iu of vitamin a for adult feamles its re or iu of vitamin a diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta carotene from their diet but the nrc national research council was going to release a new rda table in that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised c to mg per day and a to iu per day for adult males that report and it s recommendations was killed why concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full many scientist in the u s feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the s get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves we know from autopsy that only about of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve iu to iu i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients but for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol level levels above ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and it s time to stop taking retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be ug dl hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of ug dl or higher interpretation of diagnostic test wallach m d a little brown series book this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later in this post between ug dl and ug dl you should have plenty of warning that it s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it s time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pms studies beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol but taking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up i ve seen estimates of years if you are in the that only has as much as you were born with in your liver iu one other problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body uses vitamin a retinol for many different things vision the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymes one of which requires vitamin c this is why pauling has tried to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does play a role in infection interferon production for example but it s biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intake of vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and once it s formed it s used and then lost to the body this is why the nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda s most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves if they don t have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually do themselves more harm than good retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation in the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alteration and cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and or beta carotene chronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin a along with the other factors that medicine already has on it s list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou s branch campus and when i give cme lectures dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below to iu asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruled out in one study done on u s spanish americans where serum retinol levels were measured of the sample population had a serum retinol level below ug dl as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the u s that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerpts from their book vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is to ug dl lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greater than ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than mg about iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over mg iu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative i recommend that my students try iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab can t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at iu per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a recall that the pms papers were using iu to iu of vitamin a i don t suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin c status are good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is iu of retinol per day beta carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus could just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help yes but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it full vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors but when we have the m d s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation marty b',\n",

sample ftp session is given at the end of this file changes in version update from v to v in this version we have revised cosy pak to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v since mathematica provides a better and working laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than mathematica v did we adopted them this has made cosy pak smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the cosy pak v are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v for power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing available at the anonymous ftp site gauss eedsp gatech edu or ip on the downside the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica requires more runtime resources than its previous version for mathematica users we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica in
